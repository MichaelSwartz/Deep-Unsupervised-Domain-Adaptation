# DDC-specifc Fork of Deep-Unsupervised-Domain-Adaptation

This is a fork of [Deep-Unsupervised-Domain-Adaptation](https://github.com/agrija9/Deep-Unsupervised-Domain-Adaptation), which provided a more-up-to-date version of the code originally developed in (DDC-transfer-learning
)[https://github.com/syorami/DDC-transfer-learning].

**Training and inference**
---

To train the model in your computer you must download the [**Office31**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4IapRTv9pJ1WGZVd1VDMmhwdlE/view) dataset and put it in your data folder. 

Execute training of a method by going to its folder (e.g. DeepCORAL):

```
cd DeepCORAL/
python main.py --epochs 100 --batch_size_source 128 --batch_size_target 128 --name_source amazon --name_target webcam
```

**Loss and accuracy plots**
---

Once the model is trained, you can generate plots like the ones shown above by running:

```
cd DeepCORAL/
python plot_loss_acc.py --source amazon --target webcam --no_epochs 10
```

The following is a list of the arguments the usuer can provide:

* ```--epochs``` number of training epochs
* ```--source``` name of source dataset
* ```--target``` name of source dataset

Pytorch implementation of four neural network based domain adaptation techniques: DeepCORAL, DDC, CDAN and CDAN+E. Evaluated on benchmark dataset Office31.

Paper: [Evaluation of Deep Neural Network Domain Adaptation Techniques for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13420)

**Abstract**

> It has been well proved that deep networks are efficient at extracting features from a given (source) labeled dataset.
However, it is not always the case that they can generalize well to other (target) datasets which very often have a different underlying distribution. In this report, we evaluate four different domain adaptation techniques for image classification tasks: **Deep CORAL**, **Deep Domain Confusion (DDC)**, **Conditional Adversarial Domain Adaptation (CDAN)** and **CDAN with Entropy Conditioning (CDAN+E)**. The selected domain adaptation techniques are unsupervised techniques where the target dataset will not carry any labels during training phase. The experiments are conducted on the office-31 dataset.

**Results**
---

Accuracy performance on the Office31 dataset for the source and domain data distributions (with and without transfer losses).
